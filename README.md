# Prediction-and-Detection-of-Postpartum-Depression Using Machine Learning
his research project presents a comprehensive overview of postpartum depression, exploring its prevalence and various contributing factors. The
onset typically occurs within four to eight weeks after childbirth. Early detection of symptoms and prompt initiation of treatment can greatly reduce
adverse consequences. The integration of ML into mental health care holds great potential to enhance screening accuracy, improve clinical decision-
making, and ultimately contribute to better outcomes for mothers and their families. Different ML models were built on data collected through survey.
