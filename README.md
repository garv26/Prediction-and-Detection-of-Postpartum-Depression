# Prediction-and-Detection-of-Postpartum-Depression Using Machine Learning
This research project presents a comprehensive overview of postpartum depression, exploring its prevalence and various contributing factors.The
onset typically occurs within four to eight weeks after childbirth. Early detection of symptoms and prompt initiation of treatment can greatly reduce
adverse consequences. The integration of ML into mental health care holds great potential to enhance screening accuracy, improve clinical decision-
making, and ultimately contribute to better outcomes for mothers and their families. Different ML models were built on data collected through survey.

*Conducted comprehensive literature reviews and database analysis to identify risk factors associated with Postnatal Depression.
Compiled and processed self-reported survey data from patients across multiple hospitals, focusing on postpartum depression risk factors.
Developed and evaluated various machine learning models to predict postnatal depression, ultimately selecting Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with 94% accuracy.
Deployed the SVM model using Flask, creating an efficient and scalable web application.
Designed and implemented a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate intuitive interaction with the deployed model.
